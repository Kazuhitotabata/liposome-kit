# Short summaries and links

## Ishikawa et al, FEBS Letters, 2004

Rehydration of an extruded liposome "cake" has been described by Yomo
and collaborators in [Ishikawa et al, FEBS Letters,
2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579304011743),
based on a [previous
paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365999000474).

## Danelon et al, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed, 2012

A method for hydration of a lipid film stratified over glass beads has
been described by [Danelon et al, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed,
2012](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201107123);
similar experiments and be found in an [MDPI Life
paper](http://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/5/1/969).

## Oberholzer et al, Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 1999

Hydration of lipid film stratified inside a vial is a classical
method, described in [Oberholzer et al, Biochem Biophys Res Commun,
1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X99904047)
(the extrusion after hydration method can be skipped).  Additional
work in this direction is descirbed in [Yu et al, J Biosci Bioeng,
2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389172301803224).

## Fujii et al, Nature Protocols, 2014

This paper describes th droplet transfer method.  Yomo and collaborators have 
used this method in dozens of publications.  The protocol is available in
[Fujii et al, 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2014.107).
There is also a [JoVE article](https://www.jove.com/video/55282).

## Spencer et al, JoVE, 2013

The Encapsulation of Cell-free Transcription and Translation Machinery in Vesicles for the Construction of Cellular Mimics 

This paper presents a simple method for the preparation of vesicles, the encapsulation of transcription and translation machinery, and monitoring of protein production. A [JoVE paper and video](https://www.jove.com/video/51304/the-encapsulation-cell-free-transcription-translation-machinery) is available, based on the paper by Sunami et al., Synthesis of Functional Proteins Within Liposomes. *Methods Mol. Biol.* (2010).

## Ishiwata et al, Nature Protocols Exchange, 2015

Preparation of cell-sized water-in-oil droplets for *in vitro* reconstitution of biological processes in cellular compartments (modified protocol)

This is a [protocol](https://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/protocols/3815#/related-articles) for the encapsulation of the TX-TL cell-free protein expression system in the liposomes based on the paper by Miyazaki, M, Chiba, M, Ishiwata, S. Preparation of cell-sized water-in-oil droplets for *in vitro* reconstitution of biological processes in cellular compartments. (2015) Nature. DOI: 10.1038/protex.2015.029
The modified version can be found at [OpenWetWare](https://openwetware.org/wiki/Preparation_of_cell-sized_water-in-oil_droplets) The protocol was used by Malin Jonsson, Miroslav Gasparek (summer 2017 interns), and Zoila Jurado (PhD student at Caltech) to express the GFP in the liposomes in the summer of 2017 in the Murray Lab at Caltech.
